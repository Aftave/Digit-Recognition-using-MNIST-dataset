## Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset

Utilized python with TensorFlow to build and train the digit recognition model. Built and trained a Convolutional neural network (CNN) model on MNIST dataset. Performed data preprocessing and model evaluation using techniques like accuracy, confusion matrix, normalization, etc.
Built a real-time digit recognition model using computer vision a deep learning. Used python, tensorflow, webcam input to capture, process and classify hand written digits.
